Hi everyone,
This is my simple personal project: Personal_Finance_Tracker_(GUI Interface) is a simple desktop application built with python, tkinter, and sqlite. The project allows users to add income and expense transactions,
view all transactions, and visualize the budget using a clear chart. All data is stored in a local SQLite database, providing a lightweight solution for managing personal finances.
